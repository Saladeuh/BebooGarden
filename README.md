# Beboo Garden
This is a pet audio game inspired by games like Sonic Adventure 2’s Chaos Garden, Nintendogs or Tamagotchi. It’s dedicated to chill out and daily taking care of cute creatures.
Its main features are:
- Taking care of Beboos by playing with and feeding them
- Compete them in races to gain tickets that can be use to buy new items to place in Beboo Garden.
- Discovering other areas for your Beboos 

It’s a mainly a holidays little project, so I make updates when I can and when I want. I did it above all to please myself.

## next teps
Here are some ideas for next updates
- More areas

- More minigames
- New Beboo’s types
- Online features
- Night ambiances
